The Early Birds Deliverable

Chapter 1

Building Amara Steps:
1. Install Docker
2. Install Docker Compose (These two were the hardest part.)
3. Git clone the repository
4. Build Amara image using "bin/dev build" (Had to make a new virtual machine of Ubuntu)
5. Start Amara containers using "bin/dev up"
6. Configure database "bin/dev dbreset"

Testing: We ran the test suite using "bin/dev test" which did return a successful test of 965 tests in 1367.838s. We are still unsure how to view the data.
